			  			<h2>About Me</h2>
			  			<img id="me" src="assets/images/me.png">
			  				<p>My name is Andrew. However, I greatly prefer to be called Drew. I was born in Texas in Auguest of 1990, although I moved to Virginia when I was still an infant. I have am the oldest of three siblings. I preceded two younger sisters whom I adore but can also drive me insane. When I was four or five years old, I played Duck Hunt for the orignal Nintendo. Ever since then I have been hooked on technology. I have changed my mind about what aspect of technology appealed to me most so many times I have lost count. Finally, I decided I just want to learn it all, or as much as my brain is capable of handling.</p>
